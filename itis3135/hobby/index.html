                <p>I've played soccer since I can remember and still do. I was introduced to the sport by my dad when I was a kid. His favorite team was FC Barcelona and he would watch their games all the time so I also became a fan of the team too. I also started playing soccer as a kid. I would go to the park with friends or play on the a team.</p>

                <p>Soccer is a sport can be played during all seasons. Even in the winter you can play soccer. You can find a indoor fields to play at. It's a great way to keep playing soccer during the winter and not freeze outside.

                <p>You can play soccer at almost anyplace you can think of. I've playing soccer at park fields to my backyard to on the beach. If you have a ball with you, you can play.

We have a professional soccer team here with an exciting fanbase.</p>

            <h3>How to get started</h3>
            <div>
                <p>The best way to get started is to go to a game. This could be professional, college or even high school. If you're in Charlotte I would recomend going to a Charlotte FC game, they always have a great atmosphere at the games and if you would ever be able to go to a game in Europe that would be amazing. They have the atmosphere of any sport.</p>
