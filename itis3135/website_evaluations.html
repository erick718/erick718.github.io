            <h3>Good Website</h3>
            <h3><a href="https://www.swiss.com/us/en/homepage">Swiss Airlines</a></h3>
            <p>This website is great example of what a good website is. It uses all the principles of design (CRAP) and does it well.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast is really good on this website. The white background really makes the red and black pop. They also have a nice blue background which I'm pretty sure is a water.</li>
                <li>Repetition: This website has great repetition. Everything is well organized and makes sense. They use the same fonts, font colors, and font size.</li>
                <li>Alignment: This website also uses great alignment. The nav bar and body text is aligned great and every element is aligned with each other.</li>
                <li>Proximity: This website makes great use of proximity. There is spaced well and makes the website look cleaner. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Bad Website</h3>
            <h3><a href="https://www.lingscars.com/">Lings Cars</a></h3>
            <p>The website is a good example of a bad website is. It does not use the principles of design (CRAP).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast in this website is probably the worst thing about this website. There is litteraly every single color you can think of and just a lot of things going on in the background.</li>
                <li>Repetition: The repetition is also bad on this website. Many things are not the same size like the fonts.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment isn't terrible on this website. It's probably the best thing going for it. It's organized kind of well but there are things that aren't aligned well.</li>
                <li>Proximity: The proximity is also pretty bad. Everything is close together giving it a bad look and there is a huge blank space at the bottom of the page.</li>
            </ul>
